This library is for use with the SparkFun Si4735 Shield
Released under the 'Buy Me a Beer' license
(If we ever meet, you buy me a beer)

See the example sketches to learn how to use the library in your code.

For the reading of status information off the chip to work, you'll need to add
a diode between GPO1 and pin 12 or use a logic level shifter circuit. 
See http://wiki.wsartori.com/wiki/Trunet_Radio for more information on adding
in the diode.
