Arduino Si4735 Library
Written by Ryan Owens for SparkFun Electronics - 5/17/11
Altered by Wagner Sartori Junior <wsartori@gmail.com> on 09/13/11
Actively Being Developed by Jon Carrier <jjcarrier@gmail.com>

This library is for use with the SparkFun Si4735 Shield
Released under the 'Buy Me a Beer' license
(If we ever meet, you buy me a beer)

See the example sketches to learn how to use the library in your code.

For the reading commands work, you'll need to add a diode between GPO1 and pin 12 or by using a logic level shifter circuit. 
See http://wiki.wsartori.com/wiki/Trunet_Radio for more information on adding in the diode.
