This library is for use with the SparkFun Si4735 Shield
Released under the 'Buy Me a Beer' license
(If we ever meet, you buy me a beer)

See the example sketches to learn how to use the library in your code.

For the reading commands work, you'll need to add a diode between GPO1 and pin 12. It's an easy task there're some pictures on my wiki page.
