-> fix all TODOs in the files themselves
-> add HAL support (shift register routing for SEN and RESET) to the code
-> remove meaningless pins from constructor call (e.g. SDIO always connects to MOSI, no need to specify or provide constants for it)
-> implement I2C mode using Wire

-> implement proper PI decoding (worldwide, that is)
-> implement missing parts of the RDS standard
